Hello, Hi, Welcome!

Feel free to have a look around on my homepage, quench that curiosity. If you'd like to, you can go ahead and send me a message, add or an invite to chat while you're here. All I ask is that you keep in mind that I am a living, breathing human being before you do so. I'm not just some sex object that you can use whenever you desire, regardless of what I do on here as a "career." So please don't send me messages or invites being a pervert, asking me to do sexual things with or for you. No, I really don't want to see your little noodle of a peen and no, I don't want to have a relationship with you. As long as you treat me respectfully, we can be the best of friends. With all that said, I linked some of my social media accounts that you can follow or add me on. Same respectful behavior is required there as on here. I have an amazon wishlist posted here also, because I'm a broke girl who would love and appreciate you forever if you decided to spoil me. For those of you who don't like adult content, BDSM, DD/lg and or anything in between those lines, please avoid clicking on "tumblr" and "amazon wishlist." Thank you.

<p>
While I am a person with a kind heart by nature, let me just go ahead and give you a little spoiler alert now because I'm about to spoil all the fun for you. I am not your personal ATM. Which means I will not under any circumstance be giving a stranger credits. I'm sorry if your account was hacked, but that's what imvu's helpline is for. If you're being made fun of or booted for having a "noob" account, I'm also sorry, but again it's my problem nor is it my responsibility to supply you with something that's a luxury. I'm also not one for drama, it will not be tolerated. If you want someone to talk to because you're lonely and need a shoulder to cry on, I'm more than happy and willing to be your friend, but if you just want to gossip about someone who hurt your feelings by "stealing your man" my only advice to you is that he or she isn't worth the trouble and that's all I'll say about the matter.
