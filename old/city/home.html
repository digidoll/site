<h1>Welcome to the World Beautiful </h1>

<h2>The Universe</h2>
<div style="float: right; clear: right;">by Vera Dales</div> <br>
<p>
All beliefs are false. They all reside in the heart, at the core. People trick themselves into believing in books or miracles as proof, but they know such things can’t be proven by science, and so they all require faith, a human feeling in our “gut” or our “heart” or our “soul” that something is true. It’s sad to see people’s ignorance, their refusal to challenge something because it isn’t convenient. I can challenge beliefs in two simple arguments that no religion can withstand:<br>
1. How do you know that some other religion is not right? How do you know that the specific god you believe in, and his rules or his story, is the right one? By what madness do you justify taking a gamble on an infinite amount of possibilities? We can’t know all the answers, so why choose one? There is no logical reason, only to soothe the heart. You are caught up in the lies and the romance people daunt before you to hook you. True peace comes with truth. I promise, it’s real.<br>
2. You were not here forever, before you were born, and yet you remember nothing of it. No one can. <br>
Beliefs take many forms: honor, loyalty, even amongst murderers there is usually a moral compass or code and if not, they only spit at the world because they were forged that way by their life’s events. Not because of any inner knowingness or discovery of scientific nature. I know of countless atheists who believe in love without ever questioning it. Even I say, “I love you” often. I don’t believe in love though, I only use the word to express my feelings. What love really means is something beyond what a person can do for you and beyond their flesh. Nothing exists like that except in the fantasy of the mind. <br>
<p>
People believe in free will, their own power. People believe they have a soul. People believe they are special in the eyes of the universe, instead of atoms and dirt and sand transformed into an animal. People see living things as higher than robots but really they are just layered more to appear more complicated to do more complicated tasks. All things are built from simple procedures.<br>
<p>
People are so twisted with perverted ideas and I can’t stand it. It has caused ALL of their suffering yet they embrace it as if there is nothing that can be done about it. The solution is there: Think critically about everything. Entertain ideas, even if you don’t believe in them, be the antagonist to your beliefs in your mind, not just sometimes, 24/7. Constantly play scenarios and virtual realities in your head to test the strengths and weaknesses of your ideas. Be human in your actions but not in your thoughts. You have to teach yourself of human triggers and our nature. Read about it, become aware of the strings that pull you. By simply being aware you become better able to manipulate yourself. <br>
<p>
Just realize that to meet your goals and get ends out of means you have to think in different constructs as: always accept your current situation and strategize around it, or out of it, but always in the present moment. Never assume that things will be easier once X happens. Thinking in terms of tomorrow means today will never come. The world won’t fix you or make you work. Entertain the idea that maybe everything we are currently saying and doing is not of our own free will; it’s a reaction to a chain of events. My wants and desires they suggest a freedom that I’m choosing to say this. <b>It is an illusion.</b> I can’t help it anymore than you can help breathe but knowing that it’s an illusion is like knowing that breathing fills your lungs with oxygen – oxygen, a thing unknown by name and symbolic nature 10,000 years ago. Knowledge helps to become aware and awareness is the greatest difference between peace and suffering. Peace is a lot more meaningful than happiness by the way happiness is fleeting. Peace can be almost constant. The way you previously interpreted the world was by reacting to things that happened to you, and by the exciting things most of all, until tragedy or fortune cornered you into a distorted worldview of superstition and trusting in others rather than your own senses. <br>
For example: Lacking free will – what purpose is there? <br>
All people must surely have a purpose (this is what your mind usually thinks) or else, why am I alive? This thought, or similar ones, is a common conundrum and the answer to the riddle is that your purpose is not of your own choosing or divinity because you have none. Your purpose is shaped by survival instincts, without them we would be extinct. It bears no explanation beyond that. As for the reasons people’s lives were the way it was or what people went through. All things are connected in trajectory just as a person falling from a plane. There is wind resistance, the shape of the body as it falls, and other variables, the variables in our lives, and the lives before ours, the animals, the plants, the planets. There are so many variables we can’t make sense of our own lives but if you think on the grand scale you can still be wise and understand. <br>
<p>
First of all, on the fundamental level, I have no choice, just as a person will always choose clear spring water over sewer water. <br>
<p>
Asking “why” isn’t how you use means to get to an end. You don’t ask “why”, you manipulate it to your favor. Manipulation is a constant just like breathing. We are manipulating the air we breathe by breathing, the air around us by moving our arms through it like an invisible liquid, atoms in the form of food, thoughts in the form of cellular energy and tiny amounts of electricity, radiating heat from our bodies from the food we harvest and the oxygen/carbon dioxide we harvest. We are interacting always. Similarly, in personal relationships we must always be interacting, not showing our pretty faces or cleverness and hoping the other person just loves us for doing nothing else. By focusing too much on our negative energy or worries, we create it. We force that other persons mind to think about what we fear most and when they do, they get depressed. We are always influencing. You have to make it positive most of the time, positive for both people.,<br>
<p>
Concrete things don’t happen by our will, but by our awareness. You can’t ask someone to just quit smoking. You make them keenly aware of the danger, of the problems it’s causing, show them how it hurts their child with secondhand smoke, make them see how expensive the habit is, etc. Not by giving a commandment in concrete: “Stop smoking.”

As far as knowledge is concerned, knowledge only enters one way: focus/attention and being aware. All the same thing. More aware of everything but more specifically to this moment. More aware of what binds you to your beliefs and your pain. People are not happier just being oblivious. They are full of infinite contradiction and confusion. I pity them and I would never go back. By being aware of the emotions, I can notice them inside me before they make me do things and use logic instead if I so choose. I know it doesn’t seem like it, but mental exhaustion is due mostly to your emotions. You could think logically for hours on end and feel very little effort expended.<br>
<p>
It’s about finding a solution, or searching for one until one comes. If you waste time saying something is easy, hard, impossible, you get nothing done. People focus too much on words. I use the words “love” and “belief” often. It holds no negativity, its just wording. What we are aware of is everything, NOT the words.  I like solving problems on my own, most likely by trying things by moving the numbers around as I have learned to balance equations and other algebraic tricks. Math is a very valuable thing to know although I never understood its essence. Math is just like life. It’s absolute. No energy lost, just transformed. All things are always transforming. This gives me great peace and I don’t see death as a finite end. It’s just another transformation. The sun has no boundary, its light doesn’t stop, and it keeps going in infinite space. We call it the sun and look at its strongest point but sun is its energy and it’s constantly spreading. <br>
<p>
Enlightening others of these truths is not easy. They get disappointed. It usually ends in never talking again. People get infuriated and hurt or confused etc. It’s sad. I know I’m not as wise as I am smart yet. I still can’t understand why it’s so hard to see things the way the universe presents them instead of some priest, or parent, or TV show, or a book, or a dream, etc. It’s right there in front of us. <br>
<p>
Having these realizations doesn’t make me happier. That is waged by my situation as in mood, hunger or lack of, girlfriend or boyfriend etc. It makes one always at peace and content.
There is a peace beyond religion, you just aren’t fully aware of it. This peace is different because it requires no faith. All faith by its very nature divides people, because faith is based in the heart. It has multiple, countless, interpretations. One person has a dream or a hallucination and their faith may change, They may infect the hearts of others and further divide the worlds population into yet another sect of religious divide, another group of people who grow to hate people who share alternate beliefs. The notion that we will one day learn to get along with others who are constantly changing beliefs and ultimatums and having purposes of a “divine” nature beyond this life is a fool’s errand. It is dangerous. It’s the very reason the world is in suffering. Religion in itself brings nothing but money and war to those who manipulate it, at the shallow expense of an illusion and mirage for poor souls to grieve upon it and hope for a glorious heaven in an afterlife without ever thinking of the reality of their “before life” or the nothingness they experienced before being born as their true reality in this universe. All civilizations in the past once conquered were made, more or less, to abandon their religions and take on the ones of the captors, and so thus they became immersed in their culture and grew to hate their warring neighbors. Religion was a weapon and it still is. Christian nations are aligned in alliance because they share likeness.<br>
<p>
Of course all this information would be hard for anyone (including myself) to process. We are poorly designed creatures. We put a lot of value on romantic things, unless distorted as I was. Romantic, shiny ideas though they attract our senses, not the truth. <br>
